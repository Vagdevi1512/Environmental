 A CatBoost model is an open-source machine learning algorithm for supervised learning tasks like classification and regression, developed by Yandex, that uses the gradient boosting framework. Its key innovation is its efficient and automatic handling of categorical variables—which are often difficult for other algorithms—using techniques like ordered boosting and oblivious trees. This makes CatBoost a high-performance, user-friendly, and powerful option for processing tabular data with its unique methods to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. 
 
 An XGBoost model is a powerful machine learning model, short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. It excels at handling tabular data and offers high accuracy, speed, and efficiency by employing parallel processing, built-in regularization to prevent overfitting, and a sequential, error-correcting approach to model building. 
 
 A random forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees.
